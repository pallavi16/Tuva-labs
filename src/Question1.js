          What new technology-related knowledge or skills (new language, new tools, etc.)
          have you acquired in the past 12 months? Anything excites you specifically?

        <p className ="blurText">
          I started working as a software design engineer at the <b><a
          href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/">
          Huntsman Cancer Institute </a></b>, Utah,
          United States about 11 months ago and I believe that my technical stack has advanced
          tremendously since then. I worked on some major projects here involving JavaScript
          frameworks ( AngularJS, Angular5, React ), Programming Language (Java) , Server(WildFly, Orion),
           Tools (Git, Webpack, Babel), IDE(Eclipse EE, IntelliJ IDEA), Styling (CSS3, SASS).
    I worked on migrating an existing codebase written in AngularJS to Angular5. I was new to
    Angular and React when I initially joined but after building a few demo projects, I acquired a
     firm grip over JavaScript frameworks within two months. It was really exciting to work with
     a diverse team of incredibly talented engineers, developers and managers and learn new languages.

    Alongside, I recently completed the <b><a href="https://grow.google/programs/udacity/">Google Scholarship program</a></b> as a Mobile Specialist
    where I got an opportunity to work on a huge project called ‘Restaurant Review’ in three
    stages for 10 months. I learnt the concept of service workers, building a fully responsive
    mobile-ready offline-first web application, implemented various accessibility features to
     improve performance and speed (page load time). The link to the project can be found
     <b><a href="https://github.com/pallavi16/Restaurant-Review-Stage3"> here.</a></b>
     The project was really interesting and was a great resource to hone my
     technical web development skills. I believe I have become much better,
      self-driven and a more passionate front-end engineer in the past 12 months.
