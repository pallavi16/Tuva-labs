        <p className ="blurText">I found the interactive data tool for students and teachers really impressive. It has a user-friendly and a very intuitive interface that could empower the teachers to create activities for students through easy and fun datasets. With the use of sample datasets such as dinosaurs, roller coasters, the user can easily explore and understand how to use the tool. The knowledge of tool usage using this sample dataset could later allow the user to easily import their own dataset.
The content library provides a selection of unique and wide range of subjects/topics
for teachers to create student activities.
Not only the teachers, the students  could use self-guided lesson to learn and
practice specific tools and skills relevant to their course of study.
The presence of case cards with a tons of attributes and values provides the user
with a variety of data properties for their case study. The toolbar, on the other hand,
is an incredibly useful tool to easily navigate and use the graphs. With this readily
available toolbar, student's not only have the access to the datasets but also have
several options to graph the data and produce better data visualizations.
These Graphing tools provide a number of options in each activity to create bar graphs,
 histograms, line graphs, scatter plots etc.
I believe that this is a great tool to keep students  engaged and interested in reading
and learning something new by doing a lot of activities rather than using the simple,
boring traditional textbooks.
Apart from such powerful learning methodology that this tool provides, I think the
 design is also very appealing (especially for students).Overall, I believe that
 this strategy could help students apply their data literacy skills in a variety
  of contexts and get a deeper understanding of the various skills they could learn
   through TuvaLabs.
